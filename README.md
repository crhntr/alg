# A Collection of Various Algorithms

## The Book:
The book referred to in the code is an "An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms" 2nd Edition by Michael Soltys
http://www.msoltys.com/book

## Benchmarks
Some of the algorithms have test files some of those also have benchmark tests written. To run the benchmark tool for the code `cd` into the appropriate directory and run `go test -bench=.`.

## Docker
A Dockerfile is included for all algorithms so you don't need to install Go (although to run benchmarks you should use the go tool).
Simply `cd` into the appropriate directory and build/run the generated image.
